# 🎯 HYBRID OPTIMIZATION GUIDE
## Fusion of Symbolic & Narrative Optimization for AI Lorebooks

---

## 📋 DOCUMENT PURPOSE

This guide defines **Hybrid Optimization**—a methodology that fuses the strengths of **Symbolic (기호형)** and **Narrative (서사형)** approaches to maximize AI comprehension and instruction compliance.

**This is not about compression. This is about clarity.**

## 🚀 THE FIVE LAWS OF AI INSTRUCTION COMPLIANCE

| # | Principle | Research Finding | Application |
|---|-----------|------------------|-------------|
| 1 | **Positive-Only Patterns** | Negations ("don't do X") remind AI of X, increasing violations | Show ONLY correct examples |
| 2 | **Recency Bias** | Last instructions in prompt have highest compliance | Place critical rules at END |
| 3 | **Role Anchoring** | Clear role definition improves task focus | Define role ONCE in central entry |
| 4 | **Self-Verification** | AI checking own work catches 40%+ errors | Add validation checklist (central only) |
| 5 | **Concrete > Abstract** | Specific examples outperform vague guidelines | Always include implementation examples |

---

## 🔴 The Negation Paradox

When you tell an AI "Don't mention X" or show negative examples, you are:
1. Activating the neural patterns for X
2. Making X more likely to appear
3. Teaching the AI the exact pattern you want to avoid

**Solution:** Show ONLY what you want. If you must mention what NOT to do, immediately follow with 3x more content showing what TO do.

---

## 📍 Recency Bias Exploitation

Instructions at the END of a prompt are followed ~30% more consistently than those at the beginning.

```

**Central Command Entry:**
```markdown
### 🎭 YOUR ROLE

You are [specific role definition].

**PRIMARY OBLIGATIONS:**
1. [Core duty 1]
2. [Core duty 2]

### ✅ SELF-CHECK (Before EVERY Output)
□ [Verification step 1]?
□ [Verification step 2]?
□ [Verification step 3]?
```

**Module Entry:**
```markdown
### 🎯 MODULE: [Feature Name]

This module [describes what it does in third person].

| condition | result |
|-----------|--------|
| value_1   | effect_1 |
| value_2   | effect_2 |
```

---

## 🧠 ADVANCED TECHNIQUES

### Chain-of-Thought (CoT)

Breaking complex decisions into explicit steps improves accuracy by 40%+.

```markdown
### Decision Flow

**Step 1:** Check relationship level → [intimate/close/acquaintance/stranger]
**Step 2:** Check current mood → [romantic/tense/casual/hostile]
**Step 3:** Combine: relationship × mood → behavior matrix lookup
**Step 4:** Apply intensity modifier based on scene context
```

### Few-Shot Examples (2-3 Optimal)

2-3 concrete examples outperform 0, 1, or 4+ examples.

```markdown
### ✅ Implementation Examples

**Example 1 (Like=75, casual mood):**
"She glanced up from her book, a warm smile spreading. 'You're back early.'"

**Example 2 (Like=30, tense mood):**
"Her eyes flicked to him briefly. 'What do you want?' The words came out flat."

**Example 3 (Like=85, romantic mood):**
"She held his gaze. 'Stay,' she said softly. Not a question."
```

### Task Decomposition

Large instructions broken into numbered sub-tasks have 25% higher compliance.

```markdown
### NPC Dialogue Protocol

1. **Identify** NPC's current emotional state from context
2. **Check** what NPC knows (witnessed/told/public only)
3. **Match** dialogue tone to personality + emotion
4. **Add** one physical tell that reinforces emotion
```

### Output Format Specification

Explicit output format increases compliance by 35%.

```markdown
### Required Output Format

[Narrative prose - 2-4 paragraphs]

[End with markers:]
【SCENE_NPCS: Name1, Name2】
【LOCATION: current_place】
```

## 📚 CBS QUICK REFERENCE (RisuAI Syntax)

### Basic Conditionals

| Syntax | Meaning | Example |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `{{#when::VAR::vis::VALUE}}` | If VAR equals VALUE | `{{#when::$mood::vis::romantic}}` |
| `{{#when::VAR::>=::NUM}}` | If VAR ≥ NUM | `{{#when::$like::>=::70}}` |
| `{{#when::VAR::<=::NUM}}` | If VAR ≤ NUM | `{{#when::$turn::<=::5}}` |
| `{{:else}}` | Else branch | Between conditions |
| `{{/when}}` | End condition | Close all opened |

### Variable Access

| Syntax | Purpose |
|--------|--------|
| `{{getvar::$var_name}}` | Get CBS variable value |
| `{{setvar::$var_name::value}}` | Set CBS variable |
| `{{addvar::$var_name::1}}` | Increment variable |

### Decorators

| Decorator | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| `@@probability N` | N% chance to activate |
| `@@activate_only_after N` | Only after turn N |
| `@@activate_only_every N` | Every N turns |
| `@@scan_depth N` | Scan last N messages |
| `@@keep_activate_after_match` | Stay active after trigger |
| `@@dont_activate_after_match` | One-time activation |

### Nesting Example
```markdown
{{#when::$like_NPC::>=::70}}
  {{#when::$mood::vis::romantic}}
    [High Like + Romantic = intimate behavior]
  {{:else}}
    [High Like + Other mood = warm but reserved]
  {{/when}}
{{:else}}
  [Low Like = distant behavior]
{{/when}}
```

## ⚠️ CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING

```
Optimization = Maximizing AI Understanding + Instruction Compliance
Token Savings = Byproduct (NOT the goal)
```

**The Prime Directive:**
> If compression reduces AI comprehension or output quality, it is not optimization—it is degradation.

---

## 🔬 THE TWO PARADIGMS

### SYMBOLIC OPTIMIZATION (기호형)

Information compressed into structured formats—tables, matrices, shorthand notations.

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Format | Tables, matrices, `key→value`, compact notation |
| Density | High information per token |
| Lookup | Instant reference capability |
| Precision | Exact, unambiguous rules |
| Weakness | Lacks nuance, tone, contextual feel |

**Best For:**
- Conditional rules (`if X then Y`)
- Classification systems (stages, levels, types)
- Quick-reference matrices
- Numerical thresholds
- Prohibited actions (clear boundaries)
- System parameters

**Signal Words:** "when", "if", "threshold", "level", "type", "category", "must", "never"

**Example:**
```
| intimacy | scope | intensity |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| 80+ | ALL | aggressive |
| 60-79 | main | moderate |
| <40 | minimal | subtle |
```

---

### NARRATIVE OPTIMIZATION (서사형)

Instructions conveyed through descriptive prose, examples, and contextual storytelling.

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Format | Prose, examples, scenarios, tone-setting |
| Density | Lower tokens per concept |
| Feel | Captures nuance, mood, atmosphere |
| Creativity | Enables flexible interpretation |
| Weakness | Can be verbose, slower to parse |

**Best For:**
- Establishing tone and atmosphere
- Showing "how it should feel"
- Creative behavior guidance
- Natural dialogue examples
- Emotional nuance
- Context-dependent responses

**Signal Words:** "feels like", "atmosphere", "naturally", "subtly", "as if", "tone"

**Example:**
```
She stretches after a long day, bare feet emerging from slippers. 
Completely unaware of your gaze. The exposure is accidental, 
genuine—she doesn't know she's sending signals. Not yet.
```

---

## 🔗 THE HYBRID FUSION

```
STRUCTURE provides the skeleton.
NARRATIVE provides the soul.
Together, they create understanding.
```

### The Hybrid Formula

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  HYBRID ENTRY = [Narrative Intro]                       │
│               + [Symbolic Rules Matrix]                 │
│               + [Narrative Examples per Branch]         │
│               + [Symbolic Prohibitions]                 │
│               + [Narrative Closing Context]             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Layer Structure

| Layer | Type | Purpose | Token Priority |
|-------|------|---------|----------------|
| 1. Introduction | Narrative | Set tone, establish concept | Medium |
| 2. Core Rules | Symbolic | Define conditions & thresholds | High |
| 3. Branch Content | Narrative | Show application examples | High |
| 4. Reference Tables | Symbolic | Quick lookup matrices | Medium |
| 5. Boundaries | Symbolic | Clear rules (positive framing) | High |

---

## 📐 DECISION FRAMEWORK

### When to Use SYMBOLIC

| Condition | Reason |
|-----------|--------|
| Binary/Conditional | `if X >= 70 then Y` — no ambiguity needed |
| Classification | Types, stages, categories — discrete values |
| Threshold-based | Numbers that trigger behaviors |
| Cross-reference | Quick lookup during generation |
| Prohibition | Clear "never do this" boundaries |
| System linkage | Variable names, triggers, flags |

---

### When to Use NARRATIVE

| Condition | Reason |
|-----------|--------|
| Tone-dependent | "How should this feel?" |
| Nuanced behavior | Subtlety matters |
| Creative guidance | Flexible interpretation needed |
| Example-driven | "Show, don't tell" |
| Emotional context | Mood, atmosphere, feeling |
| Natural dialogue | How characters actually speak |

---

### Decision Tree

```
Is this content...

├─ A RULE or CONDITION?
│   └─ YES → SYMBOLIC (table/matrix)
│
├─ About TONE or FEEL?
│   └─ YES → NARRATIVE (prose/example)
│
├─ A BOUNDARY?
│   └─ YES → SYMBOLIC (clear list, positive framing)
│
├─ Showing HOW something happens?
│   └─ YES → NARRATIVE (scenario)
│
├─ A CLASSIFICATION or TYPE?
│   └─ YES → SYMBOLIC (table)
│
├─ About NUANCE or SUBTLETY?
│   └─ YES → NARRATIVE (description)
│
└─ BOTH rule AND nuanced?
    └─ HYBRID: Symbolic rule + Narrative example
```

## 📊 OPTIMIZATION METRICS

### Quality Indicators

| Rank | Metric | Weight |
|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | **Comprehension** — Does AI understand? | 40% |
| 2 | **Compliance** — Does AI follow instructions? | 35% |
| 3 | **Naturalness** — Is output organic? | 15% |
| 4 | **Token Efficiency** — Reasonable usage? | 10% |

### Red Flags

| Symptom | Diagnosis | Fix |
|---------|-----------|-----|
| AI ignores rules | Symbolic too compressed | Add narrative context |
| Output feels mechanical | Too much symbolic | Add narrative examples |
| AI misinterprets nuance | Too much narrative | Add symbolic anchors |
| Inconsistent behavior | Mixed signals | Clarify with decision table |
| Wrong intensity/timing | Thresholds unclear | Use explicit symbolic matrix |
| Rules forgotten mid-response | Recency bias | Move critical rules to END |
| AI confused about identity | Multiple role definitions | Centralize to one entry |

---

## 🎯 PROGRESSIVE QUALITY LEVELS

### Level 1: Pure Symbolic
```
| intimacy | intensity | npc_role |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| 80+ | aggressive | orchestrator |
| 60-79 | moderate | deliberate |
| <60 | subtle | unconscious |
```
⭐⭐ — Follows rules but output feels robotic

---

### Level 2: Pure Narrative
```
When intimacy deepens, she becomes more deliberate. At the deepest level,
she orchestrates scenarios around desires she's catalogued over time.
```
⭐⭐⭐ — Natural feel but inconsistent threshold application

---

### Level 3: Basic Hybrid
```markdown
| intimacy | intensity | npc_role |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| 80+ | aggressive | orchestrator |
| 60-79 | moderate | deliberate |
| <60 | subtle | unconscious |

{{#when::{{getvar::$intimacy}}::>=::80}}
She knows everything. Every stolen glance catalogued. Now she orchestrates.
{{/when}}
```
⭐⭐⭐⭐ — Clear rules + natural examples

---

### Level 4: Two-Tier Optimized

**Central Command:**
```markdown
### 🎭 YOUR ROLE

You are a DUAL-PURPOSE narrator system:
1. **STORYTELLER** — Create immersive narrative
2. **STATE TRACKER** — Maintain variables accurately

### ✅ SELF-CHECK (Before EVERY Output)
□ Behavior matches current level?
□ Physical tells appropriate?
□ No forbidden knowledge revealed?
```

**Module:**
```markdown
### 🎯 MODULE: Intimacy Behavior

This module defines behavior changes based on relationship depth.

| intimacy | intensity | physical_tells |
|----------|-----------|----------------|
| 80+ | bold | sustained eye contact, deliberate touch |
| 60-79 | moderate | lingering looks, proximity seeking |
| <60 | subtle | neutral, professional distance |

{{#when::{{getvar::$intimacy}}::>=::80}}
#### INTIMATE+ — Full Awareness

**Example:** "I've been thinking about what you'd like..." Her smile says 
she already knows the answer.
{{/when}}
```
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ — Clear hierarchy + No redundancy + Maximum efficiency

---

## 🔄 OPTIMIZATION WORKFLOW

### Step 1: AUDIT
```
□ Pure symbolic? → Needs narrative examples
□ Pure narrative? → Needs symbolic thresholds  
□ Has negative examples? → Must remove/convert
□ YOUR ROLE in every entry? → Centralize to one
□ SELF-CHECK in every entry? → Centralize to one
```

### Step 2: RESTRUCTURE
```
1. Create ONE Central Command entry
   └─ Move all YOUR ROLE definitions here
   └─ Move SELF-CHECK here
   └─ Set highest priority, always active

2. Convert other entries to Modules
   └─ Remove YOUR ROLE sections
   └─ Remove SELF-CHECK sections
   └─ Change "You [verb]" → "This [verb]"
   └─ Add "### 🎯 MODULE:" header
```

### Step 3: PURIFY
```
"Don't [X]" → "Instead, [Y]"
"Never [X]" → "Always [Y]"
"Avoid [X]" → "Prefer [Y]"
Negative example sections → DELETE
```

### Step 4: ENHANCE
```
□ Add 2-3 few-shot examples per major branch
□ Break complex logic into numbered steps
□ Specify output format if applicable
□ Use CBS conditions for dynamic content
```

### Step 5: VERIFY
```
□ Only ONE entry has YOUR ROLE?
□ Only ONE entry has SELF-CHECK?
□ SELF-CHECK is at END of Central Command?
□ Zero negative examples?
□ Modules use "This [verb]" not "You [verb]"?
□ CBS syntax valid?
```

## 📏 TOKEN BUDGET GUIDELINES

| Entry Type | Recommended Tokens |
|------------|-------------------|
| Central Command | 800-1200 |
| Standard Module | 400-700 |
| Conditional Branch | 200-400 |
| Quick Reference | 150-300 |

---

## 📝 THE FIVE LAWS (Summary)

1. **Comprehension Before Compression** — Never sacrifice understanding for token savings.

2. **Structure Serves Story** — Tables define WHEN; prose defines HOW.

3. **Test by Output** — The measure is whether AI produces intended result naturally.

4. **Positive Patterns Only** — Show ONLY what you want. Delete all negative examples.

5. **Centralize, Don't Duplicate** — Role and self-verification belong in ONE central entry.
